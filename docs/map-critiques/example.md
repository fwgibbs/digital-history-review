Hello.

This is a simplistic markdown example that you can see on GitHub.

# YES!
## Another heading
### yet another

this is *bold*, i mean **this** is bold. 
_underline_? nope. try __underline__. 

let's see if i can get a link to [my website](http://fredgibbs.net). yes!

## IMAGES
the syntax for displaying an image from your markdown file is like (copy the punctuation exactly):
```
![ALT-TEXT](URL "HOVER-TEXT")
```

You need to replace ALT-TEXT, URL, and HOVER-TEXT for your images.

let's try: 
```
![sample screen shot](images/image1.png "sample screen shot")
```

![sample screen shot](images/image1.png "sample screen shot")

It worked! Above you can see my screen shot I so carefully made in class on Thursday.
