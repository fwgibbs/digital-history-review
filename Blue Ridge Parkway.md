-Have you ever wondered what is like to drive a long winding scenic road? We the Digital Blue Ridge Parkway is a favored scenic route in North Carolina and Virginia. What occurred to make the route so sentimental, is what this article is about. How much land was purchased and what did our government sacrifice to build this so awesome spectacle in time. Small communities formed around the existence of this 469-mile parkway.
-Maneuvering through the website offers many choices to see what really transpired in the communities near that parkway, for instance the impoverished economies or the past recollections of a slave movement that once existed. Or going to work at the cotton mills instead of getting an education. The cotton mill or the tobacco fields were textile businesses that made Asheville. A city of industry made up of smaller farming communities along that 469-mile parkway.
-This website’s many features emphasize what lead to the creation of the new parkway. Every click on the top bar above the body of text on the opening page, takes you into the past, there based on the past articles, one can get a feeling why this road was developed. Clicking on each drop-down menu, the topics guide you through a timeline of events that occurred while setting up this road that, in a way, kept tourism flourishing to a depressing economy. The events contained within those drop-down were the happenings of the past, for example, Little Switzerland, a tourist get-a-way. Little Switzerland is a resort in North Carolina where tourists can hike on trails, visit waterfalls, and ride various trails by bicycle or motorcycle. The resort is filled with minerals mined from its past and can be reached by the new parkway set to be finished in the 1930’s, the problem was, the new parkway would infringe upon the landowners of Little Switzerland, thus making critical decisions about a parkway fits into the scheme of things. Removing land for the tourism would be counterproductive for Little Switzerland while because the parkway is taking something away from authenticity of the landscape.

-In an article about the parkway “A Digital Public History Project created by History 671: Introduction to Public History, UNC-Chapel Hill, Fall 2013,” several small projects were set to happen during this parkway’s development, including many smaller villages where tourists can get gasoline or stay for the night and play golf. While some of the villages did open that provided activities for on-goers, many did not base on the development needed for construction. Pine Spur: a park located along the parkway was originally intended to host only African-Americans, since the parkway was developed in the 1930’s, segregation was still on-going in the United States, white people in society had privileges that the black people did not, with that came tourist segregation also, the whites did not want to be associated with the blacks, even on vacation. So, Pine Spur has a look out area, but no resort was ever constructed there. Another suggested village studied was Americana Village, a small community that was more industrial than touristy. A topography report was done and determined that the land would not support sufficient building to make this village a resort. So, another project is not completed. The area with its buildings still exists but the necessary materials needed to make this community a resort, was lacking, mainly enough water to circulate through.

-While the plans for the parkway were formed early, is important to note that some of the maps were included were planning maps. And the completed map projects were in place, forming the villages was on-the-table and but evidently building the villages were in the pre-mature stages. Given that plans often changed, planning maps sometimes do not match what now lies on the ground. With the invention of the Blue Ridge Parkway, there were intentions to create many communities that offered home-like amenities. Unfortunately, some projects don’t always go due to reports from topographers. There were many mentions of land mapping on this site, working through the site and its many prompts gives navigating through the website simple, but extraordinary because of its immense branches within the site that links to so many other situations. Either being a project of a college class or even the costs of what projects might cost to creating resorts along the parkway. Whichever way you look maneuver through this site, the whole basis of the article, was the aspects of creating the Blue Ridge Parkway and what were the outcomes.
